        <td>Mirabel</td>
        <td>Mirabel is a math genius. She can solve all kinds of math problems, even the math olympaid ones. I'm sure the gene is from her mother Stefanie since she's a math maniac too.</td>

        <td>4</td>
        <td>Janet</td>
        <td>Janet is a big eater. You can have her do all the amazing things with a leaf. For example, if you take a leaf and move it in a circle in the air, she will do a back flip to chase it. When she lands, she will snatch the leaf and gobble it up.</td>

        <td>Gladys</td>
